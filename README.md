# Chrun_prediction
 # Customer Churn Prediction

This repository hosts the code and resources for a customer churn prediction project. The primary goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying customers at risk of churn.

## Project Description

This project encompasses the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It utilizes popular Python libraries to build a predictive model that can be used to proactively mitigate customer churn.

## Repository Contents

* **`data/`**: Contains the dataset(s) used for training and testing the churn prediction model.
* **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks containing the detailed analysis, including data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
* **`src/`**: Python scripts designed for modularity and reusability, facilitating data processing and model building.
* **`models/`**: Saved model artifacts after training, enabling easy deployment and future predictions.
* **`README.md`**: This file, providing a comprehensive overview of the project.
* **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vupadhayayula/Chrun_prediction.git](https://github.com/vupadhayayula/Chrun_prediction.git)
    cd Chrun_prediction
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

    * Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data, perform cleaning, and engineer relevant features.

2.  **Model Training:**

    * Execute the model training cells in the Jupyter notebooks or run the corresponding Python scripts in the `src/` directory.

3.  **Model Evaluation:**

    * Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation metrics and visualizations provided in the notebooks.

4.  **Prediction:**

    * Use the saved model in the `models/` folder to predict churn for new datasets.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
